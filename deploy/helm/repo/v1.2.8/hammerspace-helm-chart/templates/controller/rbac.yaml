# This file is part of the Hammerspace CSI Driver project.
# It defines the RBAC roles and bindings for the CSI provisioner component.
# The provisioner is responsible for creating and managing PersistentVolumes
# based on PersistentVolumeClaims in Kubernetes.

# This ClusterRole defines the permissions required by the CSI provisioner.
# It allows the provisioner to manage PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims,
# and other related resources in the Kubernetes cluster.
# It also allows the provisioner to interact with storage classes and volume snapshots.
# The ClusterRole is bound to the csi-provisioner ServiceAccount.
# This ClusterRoleBinding binds the csi-provisioner ServiceAccount to the csi-provisioner ClusterRole.
# This allows the provisioner to perform the actions defined in the ClusterRole.
# The ClusterRoleBinding is created in the same namespace as the provisioner ServiceAccount.
# The ClusterRoleBinding is necessary for the provisioner to have the required permissions
# to manage storage resources in the cluster.
# The ClusterRoleBinding is created in the same namespace as the provisioner ServiceAccount.
# This ClusterRoleBinding is specifically for the provisioner to manage volume attachments.
# It allows the provisioner to update the status of volume attachments.
# This is necessary for the provisioner to properly manage the lifecycle of volumes
# and ensure that they are correctly attached to nodes.
